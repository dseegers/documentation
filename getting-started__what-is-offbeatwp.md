# What is OffbeatWP

OffbeatWP is a component-based (more on this later) theming framework for Wordpress. But actually it's a bit more than that. It uses the most modern wordpress technologies including:

- Composer
- Dependency Injection (using [PHP-DI](http://php-di.org/))
- Webpack for compiling assets
- MVC (model-view-controller)

It's our mission to create a more professional and standardised way of developing Wordpress themes. Because Wordpress doesn't really guides you how to structure your theme, themes get's messy and every often really slow.

Besides of that every developer has it's own habits which makes it hard to onboard new developers on the project of transfer the codebase to another developer.
