# Modules

Modules are basically just [services](architecture-concepts__services.md). What makes a module special is that it can contain it's own grouped functionality. This makes it really useful for functionality that you easily want to share with other projects, are functionality that is so big that you want to have it all grouped together.

## Creating modules

OffbeatWP has a CLI command to easily create a module for you:

`wp offbeatwp make-module {name}`
